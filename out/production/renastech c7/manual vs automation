There are some major differences between manual testing and automation testing.
In manual testing, a human performs the tests step by step, without test scripts.
In automated testing, tests are executed automatically via test automation frameworks, along with other tools and software.
The biggest difference between manual and automation testing is who executes the test case. In manual testing, the human tester does it.
 In automation testing, the tool does it.
 Manual testing is the process in which QA analysts execute tests one-by-one in an individual manner. The purpose of manual testing
 is to catch bugs and feature issues before a software application goes live
 Automation testing is the process in which testers utilize tools and scripts to automate testing efforts.
